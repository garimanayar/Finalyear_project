Web-Based Smart Complaint Management System for Campuses
The CMS provides a centralized digital platform where users can easily lodge complaints online, categorize issues, and track their complaint status in real time. Administrators can manage categories, view complaints, update remarks, monitor user logs, and ensure timely resolution. The system uses PHP and MySQL at the backend, with HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery for the user interface. Hosting the system on a cloud server ensures accessibility, scalability, and secure data storage.

By automating the complaint-handling process, the CMS improves communication between users and administration, enhances transparency, reduces manual workload, and enables institutions to identify recurring issues through complaint data analysis. The system ultimately contributes to a more responsive and efficient campus grievance-redressal mechanism.
